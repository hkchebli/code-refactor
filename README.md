# Code Refactor Starter Code


## User Story

* As the User, I would like to have the code refined and fixed-up without changing any of the final results.

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
for the semantic elements, I replaced 'div' with 'main', 'section', 'footer', and 'aside'. I also removed all unneeded classes and used the attributes of their parent
* WHEN I view the HTML elements (images)
* THEN I add the alt attributes for the images in the webpage
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view multiple elements or classes with the same properties
* THEN I find a better way to appropriatly merge the classes into one class or element
